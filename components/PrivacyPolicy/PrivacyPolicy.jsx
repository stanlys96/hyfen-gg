                    <ul className="list-disc">
                    <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;</li>
                    <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li>
                    <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;</li>
                    <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;</li>
                    <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>
                </div>
                <div>

                    <p>Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.</p>

                    <p>This means that, for example, a sale can happen whenever an application runs ads, or makes statistical analyses on the traffic or views, or simply because it uses tools such as social network plugins and the like.</p>

                    <p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information, subject to exceptions set forth by the law (such as, including but not limited to, where the information is used to identify and repair errors on this Application, to detect security incidents and protect against fraudulent or illegal activities, to exercise certain rights etc.).</p>

                    <p>For us to respond to your request, it’s necessary that we know who you are. Therefore, you can only exercise the above rights by making a verifiable request which must:</p>
                    <ul className="list-disc">
                    <li>provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorised representative;</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore confirm the personal information in our possession actually relates to you.</p>
                    <p>If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can authorise a person registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf.</p>
                    <p>If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of a minor under your parental authority.</p>

                    <p>We will respond to your request within 45 days of its receipt. Should we need more time, we will explain to you the reasons why, and how much more time we need. In this regard, please note that we may take up to 90 days to fulfil your request.</p>

                    <p>Should we deny your request, we will explain to you the reasons behind our denial.</p>
                    <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. In such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request. In either case, we will communicate our choices and explain the reasons behind it.</p>
